# Simple NFT Marketplace for Digital Art

## Project Description

The Simple NFT Marketplace is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows artists and creators to mint, list, and trade digital art as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. This beginner-friendly smart contract provides essential marketplace functionality including NFT creation, listing management, secure transactions, and automated fee distribution.

Built using Solidity and OpenZeppelin contracts, this marketplace ensures security, transparency, and ease of use for both digital artists looking to monetize their work and collectors seeking unique digital assets.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize digital art ownership and trading by providing a simple, accessible platform where:

- **Artists** can easily mint and sell their digital creations without technical barriers
- **Collectors** can discover, purchase, and own unique digital art pieces with verified authenticity
- **Community** members can participate in a decentralized economy that directly supports creators
- **Transparency** is maintained through blockchain technology, ensuring fair and secure transactions

We aim to create an inclusive ecosystem where creativity meets technology, enabling artists worldwide to monetize their digital art while building a sustainable marketplace for the digital art community.
